    question: `What is the end of tenancy clean?`,
    answer: `In the UK, most tenants are required to clean up after themselves when they move out. This is known as an "end of tenancy cleaning." The process can be done either by sending someone in who does it for you or doing it yourself with help from professionals if needed!`,
  },
  {
    question: `Are your cleaners insured?`,
    answer: `We place a high value on safety and security, so all of our cleaners are insured. They also have to be bonded or background checked before they can work for us!`,
  },
  {
    question: `Do you provide the cleaning materials and equipment?`,
    answer: `We work with a team of professionals who will bring their own equipment composed entirely out eco-friendly and safe cleaning products. However, if you would like us to use your favourite brand instead just let the customer service agent know beforehand so they can accommodate accordingly!`,
  },
  {
    question: `How long typically oven cleaning is required?`,
    answer: `Average oven cleaning time is around 1.5 - 2 Hours.`,
  },
  {
    question: `How often should I clean my oven?`,
    answer: `You should wipe down your oven at least once a month to avoid the buildup of dirt and food particles, which can lead not only to an unpleasant odour but also harmful chemicals. If youâ€™ve cooked something that has splattered everywhere (such as roast or casserole), then do yourself another favour by giving it a quick clean when cooled after use - just be sure not touch any exposed parts with wet hands until afterward!`,
